##About
Circuit solver is a web application that allows users to build simple dc circuits using simple circuit elements
such as wires, resistors, voltage sources and current sources. The user can design their circuit, and given that
the circuit is valid. Circuit solver will return the current through each edge of the circuit, and the voltage
at each node in the circuit.
